				Decorators

We have discussed decorators before. Typically we described them as a class
that takes an argument that supports some protocol (methods) and returns an
object that supports the same protocol (methods). The decorator object performs
a bit differently than the decorated object. The decorator object typically
stores a reference to the decorated object and calls it when necessary.

The examples in this lecture, and the Check_Annotations class in Programming
Assignment #4, use classes to decorate functions by using the __call__ protocol
to decorate/augment how functions are called. Although, some examples don't
need classes (and just use functions) to do the decoration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Special Python Syntax for Decorators

If Decorator is the name of a decorator (a class or a function) that takes one
argument, we can use it to decorate a function object, by writing either

  def f(params-annotation) -> result-annotation:
      ...
  f = Decorator(f)

or

  @Decorator
  def f(params-annotation) -> result-annotation:

which has the same meaning. We can use multiple decorators on functions. The
meaning of

@Decorator1
@Decorator2
def f(...)
    ...

is equivalent to writing

f = Decorator1(Decorator2(f))

so Decorator1 decorates the result of Decorator2 decorating f; the decorators
are applied in the reverse of the order they appear (with the closest one to
the decorated object.

There is a decorator names staticmethod which we can use to decorate methods
defined in classes, if the method doesn't have a self parameter. Currently
Eclipse marks these as syntax errors (methods with no self parameter) but still
runs the code correctly. By using the staticmethod decorator, the syntax error
disappears.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples of Function Decorators

Here are three decorators for functions (three are classes; one can be written
easily as a function too).

(1) Track_Calls remembers the function it is decorating and initializes the
calls counter to 0; the decorator object overloads the __call__ method so that
all calls to the decorator object increment the calls counter and then actually
call the decorated function (which if recursive, increments the calls counter
for every recursive call). Once the function's value is computed and returned,
the calls counter instance name can be accessed and reset for a further calls.
Of course, I could write special query/command methods to examine/reset calls,
but in the spirit of Python I'll just access calls directly by its instance 
name.

class Track_Calls:
    def __init__(self,f):
        self.f = f
        self.calls = 0
    
    def __call__(self,*args,**kargs):  # bundle arbitrary arguments
        self.calls += 1
        return self.f(*args,**kargs) # unbundle arbitrary arguments

We can write this decorator as the following function instead

def track_calls(f):
    def call(*args,**kargs):
        call.calls += 1
        return f(*args,**kargs)

    call.calls = 0
    return call

Here we define an inner-function call, which is returned by track_calls. Before
returning this function object, a calls instance name is defined for that object
and initialzed to 0; inside the call function that instance name is incremented
before the original function (f) is called and the value it computes returned.

I will continue to show equivalent class/function definitions for the decorators
described below, but at the end I will briefly explain the reason for using
classes instead of functions: the ability to overload the __getattr__ function
for using multiple decorators


(2) Memoize remembers the function it is decorating and initializes a dict to
{}. It will use this dict to cache (keep track of and be able to access quickly)
the arguments to calls and the value ultimately returned by the function. The
decorator object overloads the __call__ method so that all calls to the
decorator object first check to see if the arguments are already cached in the
dict, and if so their associated value is returned immediately, without
executing the code in the decorated function; if not the decorated funcition is
called, its answer is cached in the dict with the function's arguments, and the
answer is returned. 

For simplicity here, I'm assuming all arguments are positional (so no **kargs).
Also,since the arguments are used as keys in a dictionary, they must be
immutable/hashable.

In this way, a function never has to compute the same value twice. This might
be useful for multiply recursive calls, as in the fibonacci function.

class Memoize:
    def __init__(self,f):
        self.f = f
        self.cache = {}

    def __call__(self,*args):
        if args in self.cache:
            return self.cache[args]
        else:
            answer = self.f(*args)
            self.cache[args] = answer
	    return answer

We can also write memoize as a function, to return a wrapper function (it can
be named anything) that does the same operations as the class above. Note that
cache, a name local to memoize, is used in wrapper but not accessible outside
wrapper (unlike what we did with call.calls above)

def memoize(f):
    cache = {}
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache: 
            return cache[args]
        else:
            answer = f(*args)
            cache[args] = answer
            return answer
    return wrapper

(3) Illustrate_Recursive remembers the function it is decorating and
initializes a tracing variable to False. The decorator object overloads the
__call__ method so that all calls to the decorator object just return the
result of calling the decorated function (if tracing is off). Calling
.illustrate(...) on the decorator calls the illustrate method, which sets up
for tracing, and then uses __call__ to trace all entrances and exists to the
decorated function printing indented/outdented information for each function
call/return.

class Illustrate_Recursive:
    def __init__(self,f):
        self.f = f
        self.trace = False
        
    def illustrate(self,*args,**kargs):
        self.indent = 0
        self.trace = True
        answer = self.__call__(*args,**kargs)
        self.trace = False
        return answer
    
    def __call__(self,*args,**kargs):
        if self.trace:
            if self.indent == 0:
                print('Starting recursive illustration'+30*'-')
            print (self.indent*"."+"calling", self.f.__name__+str(args)+str(kargs))
            self.indent += 2
        answer = self.f(*args,**kargs)
        if self.trace:
            self.indent -= 2
            print (self.indent*"."+self.f.__name__+str(args)+str(kargs)+" returns", answer)
            if self.indent == 0:
                print('Ending recursive illustration'+30*'-')
        return answer


Here is an example of illustrating how the fibonacci function is decorated and
what information it produces when called with the argument 5.

@Illustrate_Recursive
def fib(n):
    assert n>=0, 'fib cannot have negative n('+str(n)+')'
    if    n == 0: return 1
    elif  n == 1: return 1
    else:         return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

print(fib.illustrate(5))

Starting recursive illustration------------------------------
calling fib(5,){}
..calling fib(4,){}
....calling fib(3,){}
......calling fib(2,){}
........calling fib(1,){}
........fib(1,){} returns 1
........calling fib(0,){}
........fib(0,){} returns 1
......fib(2,){} returns 2
......calling fib(1,){}
......fib(1,){} returns 1
....fib(3,){} returns 3
....calling fib(2,){}
......calling fib(1,){}
......fib(1,){} returns 1
......calling fib(0,){}
......fib(0,){} returns 1
....fib(2,){} returns 2
..fib(4,){} returns 5
..calling fib(3,){}
....calling fib(2,){}
......calling fib(1,){}
......fib(1,){} returns 1
......calling fib(0,){}
......fib(0,){} returns 1
....fib(2,){} returns 2
....calling fib(1,){}
....fib(1,){} returns 1
..fib(3,){} returns 3
fib(5,){} returns 8
Ending recursive illustration------------------------------

In fact, the fib function is a good one to test both Track_Calls and Memoize.
Even for arguments under 20, it produces a tremendous number of calls and can
be sped-up tremendously by memoizing it.

Delegation of attribute lookup

When using (multiple) decorators, we need a way to translate attribute accesses
on the decorator into attribute accesses on the decorated. There is no simple
mechanism to do this with functions, but it easy to do with classes: by
overloading the __getattr__ method as follows (which should be done to all three
classes above).

    def __getattr__(self,attr):        # if attr not here, try self.f
        return getattr(self.f,attr)

So, if we use the following two decorators

    @Track_Calls
    @Illustrate_Recursive
    def fib(....):
        ...

fib is a Track_Calls object, whose .f attribute is an Illustrate_Recursive 
object whose .f attribute is the actual fib function. If we then wrote
fib.illustrate(5) Python would try to find the illustrate attribute of the
Track_Calls object; there is no such attribute, so it fails and then calls the
__getattr__ of the Track_Calls class, which "translates" the failed attribute
access into getting the same attribute from the .f object (from the decoraated
class object, an object of the Illustrate_Recursive class, which does define
such an attribute, as a method which can be called).

Generally this is called delegation: where an "outer" object that does not have
some attribute delegates the attribute reference to an inner object. Decorators
often use exactly this form of delegation, so the decorator object can process
its attributes and all the attributes of the decorated object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we will study an interesting combination of using decorators and the
functools.partial function (discussed in the previous lecture). Let's look at
the following simple decorator, which takes a function and its name as
arguments; every time the function is called the decorator prints the
function's name and the result it computes.

class Trace:
    def __init__(self,f,f_name):
        self.f = f
        self.f_name = f_name
        
    def __call__(self,*args,**kargs):
        result = self.f(*args,**kargs)
        print(self.f_name+'called: '+str(result))
        return result

Now suppose we want to decorate a function f defined simple as

def f(x):
    return 2*x

If we write

@Trace
def f(x):
    return 2*x

Python raises a TypeError exception, because the __init__ for Trace requires
two arguments, not one. We can write write

def f(x):
    return 2*x
f = Trace(f,'f')

to solve the problem, but without using the @Decorator form. Can we do something
to use this form. The problem is that we have have two arguments to __init__ but
@Decorator requires just one, so we can use functools.partial to pre-supply the
second argument.

We can write

f_Trace = functools.partial(Trace,f_name='f')
@f_Trace
def f(x):
    return 2*x

But even that is a bit clunky, because we are defining the name f_Trace but
using it only once (we are not likely to trace other functions named f). We
don't need this name; instead we can write

@functools.partial(Trace,f_name='f')
def f(x):
    return 2*x

directly using the result returned from partial as the decorator. This allows
us to use the standard @Decorator form (with possibly more than one decorator).

Now calling f(1) would cause Python to print

  f called: 2

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Problems:
1) Define a class that decorates function calls so that it keeps count of how
many times the function was called with each combination of arguments. Write
a report function that returns a list of 2-tuples, each containing the argument
and the number of times the function was called with that argument, sorted from
the most freqeuently to least frequently called argument).  Hint: this is
similar to what Track_Calls and Memoize does.

2) Define a Memoize class whose constructor also has a max_to_remember argument,
which limits the size of the dict to that number of entries (if the argument is
None, memoize all calls in the ditc). It should remember only the most recent
max_to_remember arguments. Hint: do this by keeping a list (really representing
a queue with oldest and youngest values) and a dict in synch as follows:
  (a) if the args are IN the dict, just return the result.
  (b) if the args are NOT IN the dict, and the list HAS ROOM, add the args to
         the list (at the end: youngest) and to the dict (with their computed
         value)
  (c) if the args are NOT IN the dict, and the list has NO MORE ROOM, pops the
         value out of index 0 (oldest) in the list and delete that as a key from
         the dict, then add the args to the list (at the end) and to the dict
         (with their computed value) 
Finally, write a function that returns a 4-tuple containing the number of hits
(times the function was callled on memoized arguments), misses (times the
function was callled on arguments that weren't memoized), the current size of
the list/dict, and the maximum size.
