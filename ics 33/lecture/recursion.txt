				Recursion


In this lecture we will discuss the concept of recursion and examine recursive
functions that operate on integers, strings, and lists, learning common idioms
for each. As with other topics discussed this quarter, I want to ensure that you
have a deliberate and deep understanding of recursion.

The concept of recursively defined (sometimes called inductively defined) data
types and recursion is fundamental in many areas of computer science, and this
concept should be discussed from many angles in many of your ICS classes; you
should become comfortable with seeing and applying recursion. In addition, some
programming languages (Lisp is the foremost example) use recursion (and also 
decision (if) as their primary control structures: any iterative code can be
written recursively (and recursion is even more powerful than iteration, as we
glimpsed in the EBNF lecture). Even languages that are not primarily recursive
all support recursion (and have since the late 1950s), because sometimes using 
recursion is the best way to write code to solve a problem (see the flatten
function at the end of Programming Assignment #2).

Python (and C/C++/Java) are not primarily recursive languages. Each has strong
features for iterating through data (Python has the most powerful tools for such
iteration, including generators). But, it is important that we learn how to
write recursive code in Python too. Later in the quarter we will recursively
define the linked list and binary tree data structures and see how to manipulate
them both iteratively and recursively. In ICS-46 we will revisit these data
structures many times using C++, and again see how we can manipulate them both
iteratively and recursively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recursion vs Iteration

Recursion is a programming technique in which a call to a function results in
another call to that same function. In direct recursion, a call to a function
appears in the function's body; in indirect/mutual recursion, the pattern is
some function calls some other function ... which ultimately calls the first
function. Think of f calling g and g calling f: f and g are mutually recursive
with f calling f indirectly via g, and g calling g indirectly via f.

For some data structures (not many built-into Python) and problems, it is
simpler to write recursive code than its iterative equivalent. In modern
programming languages, recursive functions may run a bit slower (maybe 5%) than
equivalent iterative functions, but this is not always the case (and sometimes
there is no natural/simple iterative solution to a problem); in a typical
application, this  time is insignificant (most of the time will be taken up
elsewhere anyway).

We will begin by studying the form of general recursive functions; then apply
this form to functions operating on int values, and then apply this form to
functions operating on strings and lists. In all these cases, we will discuss
how values of these types are recursively defined and discuss the "sizes" of
the problem solved.

Suppose that we have the problem of collecting $1,000.00 for charity, with the
assumption that when asked, everyone is willing to chip in the smallest amount
of money: a penny.

Iterative solution : visit 100,000 people, and ask each for a penny

Recursive solution:  if you are asked for a penny, give a penny to this person
                     otherwise
                        visit 10 people and ask them each to collect 1/10 the
                          amount that you are asked to raise;
                        collect the money they give you into one bag;
                        give this bag to the person who asked you

In the iterative version each subproblem is the same; raising a penny. In the
recursive solution, subproblems get smaller and smaller until they reach the
problem of collecting a penny (they cannot get any smaller: this problem has the
smalles size).

The general form of a directly recursive function is

def Solve(Problem):
    if (Problem is minimal/not decomposable: aka the base case)
      Solve Problem directly; i.e., without recursion
    else:
       (1) Decompose Problem into one or more SIMILAR,
             STRICTLY SMALLER subproblems: SP1, SP2, ... , SPn
       (2) Recursively call Solve (this function) on each
             subproblem: Solve(SP1), Solve(SP2),..., Solve(SPN)
       (3) Combine the solutions to these smaller subproblems into a
             solution that solves Problem (the one this function call solves)
       (4) Return the solution to Problem

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple Recursion in Python:

We will start by examining a recursive definition for the factorial function
(e.g., 5! reads as "five factorial") and then a recursive function that
implements it.  The definition is recursive because we define a big factorial
in terms of a smaller factorial. Note that the domain of the factorial function
is the non-negative integers (also called the natural numbers).

   0! = 1
   N! = N*(N-1)!  for all N>0, 

By this definition (and just substitution of equals for equals) we see that

  5! = 5*4! = 5*4*3! = 5*4*3*2! = 5*4*3*2*1! = 5*4*3*2*1*0! = 5*4*3*2*1*1

The first definition below is a transliteration of the general code above.

def factorial (n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        sub_problem        = n-1 
        solved_sub_problem = factorial(sub_problem)
        solved_n           = n*solved_sub_problem
        return solved_n

The next definition is a simplification of how this function should really be
written in Python, without all the intermediate names, which are not needed.

def factorial (n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)

This looks clean and closes mirrors the recursive mathematical description of 
factorial. In fact, because of the simplicity of this particular recursive
function, we can write an even simpler solution using a conditional expression;
but I prefer the solution above, because it is more representative of other
recursive solutions (to more complicated problems).

def factorial (n):
    return 1 if n == 0 else n*factorial(n-1)

we can contrast the recursive code with the iterative code that implements the
factorial function

from goody import irange
def factorial (n):
    answer = 1;
    for i in irange(2,n)
        answer *= i
    return answer

Note that this function defines two local names (answer and i) and binds 1 to
answer and rebinds it to a new value during each execution of the for loop's
body. Likewise, i is rebound to a sequence of values produced when the function
iterates over the irange(2,n). The recursive function defines no local names and
doesn't rebind any names (although each recursive call binds the parameter in
the recursive function call).

Rebinding the values of names make it hard for us to think about the meaning of
code (they make it tougher to prove that the code is correct too), and makes it
hard for multi-core processors to coordinate in solving a problem. "Functional
programming languages" (those that allow binding of a name to computed value,
but no rebinding to that names) are more amenable to be automatically
parallelizable (can run more quickly on multi-core computers). You'll see more
about this in later classes at UCI (e.g., Concepts of Programming Languages).

We can mimic factorial's recursive definition for a function that raises a
number to an integer power. Note that the domain of n for this power function
requires n to be a the non-negative integer.

  A**0 = 1         (yes, this is even true when A=0)
  A**N = A*A**N-1  for all N>0

We can likewise translate this definition into a simple recursive Python
function

def power(a,n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*power(a,n-1)

By this definition (and just substitution of equals for equals) we see that
calling power(a,n) requires n multiplications.

   power(a,3) = a*power(a,2) = a*a*power(a,1) = a*a*a*power(a,0) = a*a*a*1


Of course we could write this code iteratively as follows, which also requires
n multiplications

def power(a,n):
    answer = 1
    for i in irange(1,n):
        answer *= a
    return answer

But there is a another way to compute power(a,n) recursively, shown below. This
longer function requires between Log2 n and 2*Log2 n multiplications. Here Log2
means the log function using a base of 2. Noet Log2 1000 is about 10,
Log2 1,000,000 is about 20, Log2 1,000,000,000 is about 30): so, to compute
power(a,1000) requires between 10 and 20 multiplications (not the 1,000
multiplcations required by the original definition of power).

def power(a,n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
       if n%2 == 1:
           return a*pow(a,n-1)
       else:
           temp = pow(a,n//2)
           return temp*temp

Here we bind temp once and then use its value, which is fine for functional
programming. We could get rid of the local name temp by defining the local
function

def square(n): n*n

inside power and and calling it in the else clause: return square( pow(a,n//2) )

For one example
    power(a,16) computes pow(a,8) and returns its result with 1 more
    multiplication; power(a,8) computes pow(a,4) and returns its result with
    1 more multiplication; power(a,4) computes pow(a,2) and returns its
    result with 1 more multiplication; power(a,2) computes pow(a,1) and returns
    its result with 1 more multiplication; power(a,1) computes a*pow(a,0),
    which requires 1 multiplication: computing pow(a,0) requires 0
    multiplications (it just retuns a value).

    In all, power(a,16) requires just 5 multiplications, not 16. Note that this
    function is not guaranteed to always use the minimum number of
    multiplications. Power(a,15) uses 6  multiplication, but computing
    x3 = x*x*x then x3*(square(square(x3))) requires only 5: see the topic
    named "addition-chain exponentiation" if you are interested in what is
    known about the minimimal number of multiplications for exponentiation.

We will prove that this function computes the correct answer later in this
lecture. Truth be told, we can write this function iteratively, but it looks
much more complicated and is much more complicated to analyze its behavior and
prove it correct.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hand Simulation

Next, we will learn how to hand-simulate a recursive functions using a "tower of
call frames" in which each resident in an apartment executes the same code
(acting as the function) to compute a factorial: he/she is called by the
resident above and calls the resident underneath, when a recursive call is
needed (calling back the resident above when their answer is computed). While
it is useful to be able to hand-simulate a recursive call, to better understand
recursion, hand-smulation is not a good way to understand or debug recursive
functions (the 3 proof rules discussed below are a better way). I will do this
hand simulation on the document camera, using the following form for computing
factorial(5).

      Factorial Towers

    | n =             |
    | return ...      |
    +-----------------+

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proof Rules for Recursive Functions

Now, we will learn how to verify that recursive functions are correct by three
proof rules. Even more important than proving that existing functions are
correct (to better understand them), we will use these same three proof rules
to guide us when we synthesize new recursive functions.

Note that in direct recursion, we say that the function "recurs", not that it
"recurses". Recurses describes what happens when you bang your toe into a door
the second time. Programmers who use the word recurse are not well educated.
Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize winning book, "Godel, Escher, Bach" is an
investigation of cognition, and commonly uses recursion and self-reference to
illustrate the concepts it is discussing.

The three proof rules should be simple to apply in most cases. These rules
mirror rules for proofs by induction in mathematics.

1) Prove that the base case problem is processed correctly.
   Should be easy, because base cases are small and simple.

2) Prove that each recursive call gets closer to the base case.
   Should be easy because there are "standard" ways to recur: ints go down
   by 1 or a factor of 10 (i.e., x//10 has one fewer digit; x%10 has one digit);
   Strings recur on a substrings (fewer characters); tuples/lists recur on a 
   subtuples/sublists.

3) ASSUMING ALL RECURSIVE CALLS SOLVE THEIR SMALLER SUBPROBLEMS CORRECTLY, prove
     what the code combines these solved subproblems to solve Problem (the
     parameter of the function).
   Should be easy, because we get to assume something very important and
   powerful: all subproblems are correctly solved.

Here is a proof, using these 3 rules, that the factorial function is correct:

1) The base case is 0; and according to the recursive mathematical definition,
0! = 1. This function recognizes an argument of 0 and returns 1 for it.

2) If n is a non-negative number that is not 0 (not the base case), then n-1 is
closer to 0 (the base case) than n is. It is closer by 1: the distance between
n-1 and 0 is 1 less than the distance between n and 0.

3) Assuming factorial(n-1) computes (n-1)! correctly, this function returns
n*factorial(n-1), so it returns n*(n-1)! which according to the mathematical
definition is the correct answer for n!, the parameter to this function.

Notice that the focus of the proof is on one call of the function: the parts
concern only the base case and the recursive case: and for the recursive case,
we don't worry about more recursive calls, because we get to assume that any
recursive calls (on smaller problems, closer to the base cases) compute the
correct answer without having to think about what happens during the recursion.

Proof that fast-power function is correct (the code is duplicated from above):

def power(a,n):
    def square(n) : n*n
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
       if n%2 == 1:
           return a*pow(a,n-1)
       else:
           return square( pow(a,n//2) )

1) The base case is 0; and according to the recursive mathematical definition,
a**0 = 1. This function recognizes an argument of 0 and returns 1 for it.

2) If n is a non-negative number that is not 0 (not the base case), then if
n is odd, n-1 is closer to 0 (the base case) than n is; if n is even (it must
be >= 2), n//2 is also closer to 0 (the base case) than n is.

3) Assuming pow(a,n-1) computes a**(n-1) correctly and pow(a,n//2) computes
a**(n//2) correctly. If n is odd, this function returns a*a**(n-1), so it
returns (by simplifying) a**n, which is the correct answer for the parameters
to this function; likewise, if n is even, this function returns the value
square(a**(n//2)), which returns (by simplifying) a**n, which is the correct
answer for the prameters to this function. For example, take any even number,
say 10. square (a**(10//2)) = square (a**5) = a(a**5)**2 = a**10.

Again, the focus of the proof is on one call of the function: the parts concern
only the base case and the recursive case (now two cases, depending on whether
n is odd or even): and for the recursive cases, we don't worry about more
recursive calls, because we get to assume that any recursive calls (on smaller
problems, closer tothe base cases) compute the correct answer  without having
to think about what happens during the recursion.

What happens if we write factorial incorrectly? Will the proof rules fail. Yes,
for any flawed definitions one will fail. Here are three examples (one failure
for each proof rule).

def factorial (n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0			# 0! is not 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)

This factorial function violates the first proof rule. It returns 0 for the
base case; since everything is multiplied by the base case, ultimately this
function always returns 0. Bar bet: you name the year and the baseball team,
and I will tell you the product of all the final scores (last inning) for all
the games they played that year. How do I do it and why don't I make this kind
of bet on basketball teams?

def factorial (n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return factorial(n+1)//(n+1)    # n+1 not closer to base case: 0

This factorial function violates the second proof rule. It recurs on n+1, which
is farther away from -not closer to- the base case. Although mathematically
(n+1)!/(n+1) = (n+1)*n!//(n+1) = n! this function will continue calling
factorial with ever-larger arguments: a runaway (or infinite) recursion.
Actually, each recursive call can take up some space (to store its argument, see
the hand simulation, which requires binding an argument for each recursive
call), so eventually memory will be exhausted and Python will raise an 
exception.

Actually, Python limits the the number of times any recursive function can
call itself. We can examine/set the recursion limit by importing the sys module
and the calling sys.getrecursionlimit()/sys.setrecursrionlimit(some number)
functions.

def factorial (n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n+factorial(n-1)         # n+(n-1)! is not n!

This factorial function violates the third proof rule. Even if we assume that
factorial(n-1) computes the correct answer, this function returns n added (not
multiplied) by that value, so it does not return the correct answer. In fact,
it returns one more than the sum of all the integer from 1 to n (because for 0
it returns 1) not the product of these numbers.

In summary, each of these functions violates a proof rule and therefore doesn't
always return the correct value. The first function always returns the wrong
value; the second function never returns a value; the third function returns
the correct value, but only for the the base case.

We can actually prove that these proof rules are correct! Here is the proof.
This is not simple, but it is short so I will write the proof here and let you
think about it (and reread it a dozen times if you need to).

Assume that we have correctly proven that these three proof rules are correct
for some recursive funtion f. And assume that we assert that the function is
not correct. We will show that these two assertions lead to a contradiction: if
f is not correct, then there must be some problems that it does not correctly
solve. And, if there is a problem that f does not correctly solve, there must
be a SMALLEST problem that it does not correctly solve: call this problem p.

Because of proof rule (1) we know that p cannot be the base case, because we
have proven f solves base cases correctly. Since f solves p by recursion, it
first recursively solves a problem smaller than p: we know by proof rule (2)
that it always recurs on a smaller problem; and we know f correctly solves this
smaller problem, because p, by definition, is the smallest problem that f solves
incorrectly. But we also know by proof (3) that if f recurs and correctly solves
a smaller problem (as it does for p), it will correctly solve the original
problem, p. Therefore, it is impossible to find a smallest problem that f
incorrectly solves; so, f must solve all problems correctly.

Well, that is how the proof goes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mathematics Recursively

We can construct all the mathematical and relational operators on natural
numbers (integers >= 0) given just three functions and if/recursion. We can
recursively define the natural numbers as:

   0 is the smallest natural number
   for any natural number n, s(n) (the successor of n: n+1) is a natural number

Now we define three simple functions z(ero), p(redecessor), and s(uccessor).

def z(n):		# z(n) returns whether or not n is 0
    return n == 0

def s(n):		# s(n) returns the successor to n (n+1)
    return n+1

def p(n):		# p(n) returns the predecessor of n, if one exists
    if not z(n):	# o0 has no predecessor
        return z-1
    else:
        raise ValueError('z: cannot compute predecessor of 0')

Note we should be able to prove/argue/understand the following:

z(s(n)) is always False
p(s(n)) is always n
s(p(n)) is n if n != 0 (otherwise p(n) raises an exception)

Given these functions, we can define functions for all arithmetic (+ - * // **)
and relational ( == <... and all the other relational) operators. For example

def sum(a,b):
    if z(a):				# a == 0
        return b			# return b: 0 + b = b
    else:      				# a != 0
        returns sum( p(a), s(b) )	# return (a-1)+(b+1) = a+b

Proof of correctness

1) The base case is a==0; and according to our knowledge of of mathematics,
sum(0,b) is 0+b which is b. This function returns b when the argument a == 0.

2) If z(a) is not True (a is not 0), then p(a) as the first agument in the
recursive call to sum is closer to the base case of 0. Becaue a is not 0, there
is a predecessor of (a number one smaller than) a.

3) Assuming that sum(p(a),s(b)) computes its sum correctly, we have
sum(p(a),s(b)) = (a-1)+(b+1) = a + b = sum(a,b), so returning this result
correctly returns the sum of a and b.

Another way to define this function is

def sum(a,b):
    if z(a):				# a == 0
        return b			# return b: 0 + b = b
    else:      				# a != 0
        returns s(sum( p(a), b )	# return (a-1)+(b) + 1 = a+b

We can als use the3 proof rule to prove this function correctly computes the
sum of any two non-negative integers.

We can similarly define the mult function, multiplying by repeated addition.

def mult(a,b):
    if z(a):				# a = 0
        return 0			# return 0: 0*b = 0
    else:      				# a != 0
        return sum(b, mult(p(a),b))     # return b+((a-1)*b) = b+a*b-b = a*b

Switching from arithmetic to relational operators....

def equal(a,b):
    if z(a) or z(b):		# a = 0 or b = 0 (either == 0)
        return z(a) and z(b)	# return True (if both == 0) False (if one != 0)
    else:      			# a != 0 and b != 0
        return equal(p(a),p(b))	# return a-1==b-1 which is the same as a==b

We also might find it useful to do a hand simulation of these functions, with
the two parameters a and b stored in each "apartment" and passed as arguments.
 
The right way to illustrate all this mathematics is to write a class Natural,
with these methods, and then overload/define __add__ etc. for all the operators.
I just didn't have the time to do that now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Synthesizing recursive string methods

We can define strings recursively:
  '' is the smallest string
  a character catenated to the front of a string is a string

Let's use these proof rules to write a reciple for synthesizing (and therefore
proving correct as we are writing them) a few recursive functions that process
strings. Here is our approach:

(1) Find the base (non-decomposable) case(s)
    Write the code that detects the base case and returns the correct answer
      for it, without using recursion

(2) Assume that we can decompose all non base-case problems and then solve
      these smaller subproblems via recursion
    Choose (requires some ingenuity) the decomposition; it should be "natural"

(3) Write code that combines these solved subproblems (often there is just one)
       to solve the problem specified by the parameter

We can use these rules to synthesize a method that reverses a string. We start
with

def reverse(s):

(1) Please take time to think about the base case: the smallest string. Most
students will think that a single-character string is the smallest, when in
fact a zero-character string (the empty string) is smallest. It has been my
experience that more students screw-up on the base case than the recursive case.
Once we know the smallest string is the empty string, we need to detect it and
return the correct result without recursion: the reverse of an empty string is
an empty string.

def reverse(s):
    if s == '':		# or len(s) == 0
        return ''
    else:
        Recur to solve a smaller problem
        Use the solution of the smaller problem to solve the original problem

We can guess the form of the recursion as reverse(s[1:]) note that the slice
s[1:] computes a string with all characters but the one at index 0: all the
characters after the first. We are guaranteed to be slicing only on non-empty
strings (those whose answer is not computed by the base case), so slicing will
always be a smaller string. We get to assume that the recursive call correctly
returns the reverse of the string that contains all characters but the first.

def reverse(s):
    if s == '':		# or len(s) == 0
        return ''
    else:
        Use the solution of reverse(s[1:]) to solve the original problem

Now, think about an example. if we called reverse('abcd') we get to assume that
the recursive call works: so reverse(s[1:]) is reverse('bcd') which we get to
assume returns 'dcb'). How do we use the solution of this subproblem to solve
the original problem, which must return 'dcba'? We need to catenate 'a' (the
first character, at s[0]) to the end of the reverse of all the other characters:
'dcb' + 'a', which evaluates to 'dbca', the reverse of all the characters in
the parameter string. Generally we write this function as

def reverse(s):
    if s == '':		# or len(s) == 0
        return ''
    else
        return reverse(s[1:]) + s[0]

We have now written this method by ensuring the three proof rules are satisfied
so we dont' have to prove them, but note that 

(1) the reverse of the smallest string (empty) is computed/returned correctly

(2) the recursive call is on a string argument smaller than s
    (all the characters from index 1 to the end, skipping the character at
     index 0, and therefore a string with one fewer characters)

(3) ASSUMING THE RECURSIVE CALL WORKS CORRECTLY FOR THE SMALLER STRING, then
    by catenating the first character on the end of it, we have correctly
    reversed the entire string (solving the problem for the parameter)

In fact, we can use a conditional expression to rewrite this code as a single
line as well.

def reverse(s):
    return ('' if s == '' else reverse(s[1:]) + s[0])

Here is a similar recursive function for reversing the values in a list.

def reverse(l):
    if l == []:				 # or len(l) == 0
        return [];
    else
        return reverse(l[1:]) + [l[0]]  # [l[0]] for right operand of +

Now we will write a recursive function that returns the string equivalent of an
int using the same approach: satisfying the three proof rules. We know that
Python's str function, automatically imported from the builtins module) will
return the string representation of an int. We can actually now write this
function recursively and at the same time prove it is correct. 

To start, we assume that the integer is non-negative (and fix this assumption
later). Unlike the factorial and power functions, here the size of the integer
will be the number of digits it contains: the smallest non-negative integer (0)
contains 1 digit, so that is the smallest size problem. So, we start with the
header and base case.

def to_str(n):
    if 0 <= n <= 9:
        return '0123456789'[n]			# 0<=n<=9, so no index error
    else:
        Recur to solve a smaller problem        # n has at least two digits
        Use the solution of the smaller problem to solve the original problem

We can guess the form of the recursion as to_str(n//10) and to_str(n%10)
because n//10 is all but the last digits in n and n%10 is the last digit. If
N has at least d digits (where d>=2), then both n//10 and n%10 will have fewer
digits: n//10 has d-1 digits and n%10 has 1 digit. 

We get to assume that the recursive call correctly returns the string
representation of these numbers.

def to_str(n):
    if 0<= n <= 9:
        return '0123456789'[n]			# 0<=n<=9, so no index error
    else:
        Use the solution of to_str(n//10) and to_str(n%10)

Now, think about an example. if we called to_str(135) we get to assume that
the recursive calls work: so to_str(n//10) is to_str(13) which we get to assume
is '13' and to_str(n%10) is to_str(5) which we get to assume is '5'. How do we
use the solution of these subproblems to solve the original problem? We need to
catenate them togther. Generally we write this function as

def to_str(n):
    if 0<= n <= 9:
        return '0123456789'[n]			# 0<=n<=9, so no index error
    else:
        return to_str(n//10) + to_str(n%10)

We have now written this method by ensuring the three proof rules are
satisfied. Note that 

(1) the to_str of the smallest ints (1 digit) are computed/returned correctly

(2) the two recursive calls are on int arguments that are smaller than n by at
    least one digit

(3) ASSUMING THE RECURSIVE CALLS WORK CORRECTLY FOR THE SMALLER int , then
    by catenating the two numbers together, we have correctly found the string
    representation of the n (solving the original problem)

We make this function work for negative numbers by redefining to_str with
its original code in a locally defined function, changing the body of this
function by either appending nothing or a '-' in front of the answer, depending
on n.

def to_str(n):
    def to_str1(n)
        if 0<= n <= 9:
            return '0123456789'[n]		# 0<=n<=9, so no index error
        else:
            return to_str(n//10) + to_str(n%10)

    return ('' if n >= 0 else '-')+to_str1(abs(n))
    # or
    #return (to_str1(n) if n >= 0 else '-'+to_str1(-n))

In fact, the following function uses the same technique (but generalizes it by
converting to an arbitrary base) to compute the string representation of a
number in any base from binary up to hexadecimal: to_str(11,2) returns '1011'

def to_str(n,base=10):
    if 0<= n <= base-1:
        return '0123456789ABCDEF'[n]            # 0<=n<=9, so no index error
    else:
        return to_str(n//base,base) + to_str(n%base,base)

Now let's write a method that has two recursive parameters. Suppose we want to
write a same_length function that tests whether the length of its two string
parameters are equal, without ever explicitly computing the length of each.
With two recursive parameters we have possible 4 base conditions

                               Parameter 2
                          Empty      Not empty
                        +----------+----------+
            Empty       | Equal    | Not equal|
Parameter 1             +----------+----------+
            Not Empty   | Not Equal|   recur  |
                        +----------+----------+

In three of the four, we immediately know the answer. If both parameters are
empty then the strings have the same length; if one parameter is empty and one
isn't, then the strings have different lengths. Only if both are not empty do
we need to recur to compute the correct answer.

Here are three ways to write the base cases.

    if s1 == '' and s2 == '':
        return True
    if s1 == '' and s2 != '':
        return False
    if s1 != '' and s2 == '':
        return False;

    if s1 == '':
        return s2 == ''
    if s2 == ''
        return False			      # if got here, s1 != ''

    if s1 == '' or s2 == '':                  # if either is empty, will return
        return s1 == '' and s2 == ''          # return True if both empty

    if s1 == '' or s2 == '':                  # if either is empty, will return
        return s1 == s2                       # return True if the same (empty)

So we can start this function as

def same_length(s1,s2)    
    if s1 == '' or s2 == '':
        return s1 == '' and s2 == ''
    else:
        Recur to solve a smaller problem        # s1/s2 each are not empty
        Use the solution of the smaller problem to solve the original problem

Now, if Python executes the else: clause then it has two non-empty strings, for
each of which we can compute a substring (all the characters after the first).
If the substrings have the same length, then the original strings have the same
length; if the substrings don't have the same length then the original strings
don't have the same length. So, solving this problem for the substrings is
exactly the same as solving it for the original strings. So we can write the
recursive call as

def same_length(s1,s2):    
    if s1 == '' or s2 == '':
        return s1 == '' and s2 == ''
    else:
        same_length(s1[1:],s2[1:])

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recursive list processing

Finally, here are some some simple recursive list processing functions. As with
strings, we can slice a list to get a smaller list, with the slice l[1:]
especially common and useful.

Could you start from scratch and define this as illustrated above?

We can define lists recursively:
  [] is a list
  a value catenated to the front of a list is a list

If there were not len function for lists, we could easily define it recursively
as 

def len(l):
    if l == []:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + len(l[1:])

Likewise for a sum function

def sum(l):
    if l == []:
        return 0
    else:
        return l[0] + sum(l[1:])

Below, the all_pred function returns True if and only if predicate p always
returns True, when called on every value in the list.

def all_pred(l,p): # where p is some predicate whose range includes l's values
    if l == []:
        return True
    else:
        return p(l[0]) and all_pred(l[1:],p)

Note that because and is a short-circuit operator, it recurs only as far as the
first False value, at which point it does not need to call all_pred(l[1:])
recursively. When we study efficiency, we will discover that the way Python
represents lists (as growable arrays) make recursion inefficient compared to
iteration, but when we study linked list and trees (briefly this quarter,
extensively in ICS-46) we will see for those implementations, recursion is as
fast at iteration.

Finally, you might wonder why the base case, all([],p) returns True. What
should the function return for an empty list? Well, imagine we are one call
before the empty list: a list with one value. What should all([a],p) return.
Well, it should return p(a) (True if p(a) is) True for this one-element list.
What does the recursive function return: p(a) and all([],p). So we need to
solve the equation by determing what all([],p) should be.

p(a) == p(a) and all([],p)

To solve this equation, and determine the value of all([],p), we find that
all([],p) must be True (if it were False, p(a) and all([],p) would be the same
as p(a) and False, which would always be False, not the required answer of p(a).

Based on this same logic, here are what based cases must be, categorized by
the operator before the recursive call.

base case = True  ...     and recursive-call
base case = False ...     or  recursive-call
base case = 0     ...     +   recursive-call
base case = 1     ...     *   recursive-call
base case = -infinity ... max(...,recursive_call)
base case = +infinity ... min(...,recursive_call)

Generally x op recursive-call(base case) must be x, which it is for all these
values. and operators.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problems:

1. Define a recursive function named is_odd using the functions z, p, and s
described in the lecture, which computes whether or not its argument is an odd
value.

2. Define a recursive function named remove, which takes string and a
1-character string, and returns a string with the specified character removed:
remove('afghanistanbananastand','a') returns 'fghnistnbnnstnd'.

3. Define a recursive function named replace, which takes string and two
1-character strings, and returns a string with the first specified character
replaced byh the second: remove('potpourri','o','O') returns 'pOtpOurri'.

4. Define a recursive function named contains, which takes a list and a value as
arguments, and returns whether or not the value appears in the list.

5. Define a recursive function named is_sorted, which takes a list as an
argument, and returns whether or not the list of values is non-decreasing (each
is >= to the value preceding it).

6. Define the function equals(s1,s2), which computes whether two strings are ==
without ever comparing more than 1-character strings.

7. Write less_than(s1,s2) which computes whether s1 < s2 (where both are
strings) without ever comparing more than 1-character strings. The result
should be the same as using < (the standard Python comparision).

8. Write a function named min_stamps that takes an amount as an argument and
returns the minimum number of stamps that you need to make that amount. Assume
inside the function you would define denominations as a list with all the stamp
amounts: e.g., denominations = [1, 2, 5, 12, 16, 24]. With these denominations
min_stamps(19) returns 3 (denominations 1, 2, 16 or 2, 5, 12).
